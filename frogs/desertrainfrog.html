        <h1>Desert Rain Frogs</h1>

        <p>This species of frog is native to Namibia and South Africa and is known for it's short head 
            and round body. It's natural habitat is in a narrow strip of sandy shores. As tourism and mining
            continue to harm their ecosystem, they are sadly becoming endangered.</p>

        <p> Desert rain frogs are nocturnal, and spend most of the daytime in a burrow surrounded by moist sand.
            Although they hatch eggs, unlike other frogs they do not have a tadpole stage. They are also well known
            for the high pitched squeaking sounds they make when threatened, which has become the central focus of 
            several viral videos. <p>
