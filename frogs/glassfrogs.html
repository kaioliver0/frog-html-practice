        <h1>Glass Frogs</h1>

        <p>The term "glass frog" actually refers to several different species of frog, specifically those of
            the amphibian family Centrolenidae. Although they are typically bright green, they are known as "glass frogs"
            due to the translucent skin on their abdominal area. </p>

        <p>Their natural habitat is within South and Central America, where they live in trees. 
           They are small, usually only about 1.2 to 3 inches in length!</p>
